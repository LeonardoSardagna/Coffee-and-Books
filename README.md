###

<p align="left">Welcome to the README of our online book site! I developed this project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, based on the knowledge gained from various courses over time.</p>

###

<h2 align="left">Overview</h2>

###

<p align="left">The main goal of this website is to offer a simplified and efficient experience for book lovers. One of the key innovations I implemented was the way books are managed on the site. Previously, it was necessary to manually add each book, but now, I have developed a solution that allows for the automatic update of the book list through a request.</p>
